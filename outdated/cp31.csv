Its genetics are commonly referenced as a 3-way cross between Jack Herer (sativa), Northern Lights (indica), and Haze (sativa), however, some European growers have indicated the use of Big Bud Indica instead of Haze. Either phenome is said to be highly potent and very fast acting, having the potential of containing a THC concentration. The typical THC potency of Mega Jackpot rangest between 18%-20%, with 0.05% CBD.
 
Due to its purple hues, Mega Jackpot has a distinctive look with a generous coating of small-ish trichomes to give it a sparkly look. Mega Jackpot has an indica-like, structure being a bushy plant with dark green leaves, large and dense buds, and a thick stalk. 
 
Mega Jackpot has a well-pronounced aroma that is dominated by earthy, skunky and herbal tones, however, the terpene profile is rather complex and users identify a variety of notes ranging from grape and musk, to vanilla and pine. 
 
Medicating with Mega Jackpot is said to stimulate the mind and lift the mood, leading to increased thoughtfullness and a state of happiness and relaxation. Due to its calming effects, Mega Jackpot has been used by medical patients for stress relief, help with mild headaches or light chronic pain, and if used before bed, it as a sedative for overcoming insomnia.",Sacred Flower Farms,"Purveyors of Goodness
Sacred Flower Farms is an OLCC-licensed recreational cannabis producer in the heart of Southern Oregon committed to self-sustaining cultivation methods that go above and beyond to create a superior product.
Much of the cannabis industry has been taken over by chemical nutrient manufacturers. Growers have forgotten how to grow with nature. We believe that only the cleanest flowers can truly showcase the healing properties of cannabis.

An Honest Grow
We never use synthetic fertilizers, poisonous pesticides or harmful herbicides. We grow almost 100% of our farm inputs on site, alongside food for our families. We utilize Probiotic, Living Organic and Korean Natural Farming practices that build a better soil year after year, and a better product as a direct result.
We rely on a ""plants feed plants"" method, making our nutrients through lacto fermentations, as well as sprouted seed teas, compost teas, and botanical teas using homegrown, organic plants and herbs. A healthy soil food web is essential to a deficiency-free, pest-free garden and healthy, clean plants.

Share The Love
Our desire is to show that a sustainable, living organic flower can fully unleash the terpenes, flavonoids, and beneficial properties of the cannabis plant; exciting, enlightening, and healing consumers. We strive to be a model of the way cannabis can and should be cultivated.
We hope you are excited by the flowers produced through our careful strain selection and mindful farming practices, and encourage you to spread the good word about the work we do."

2003 High Times Cannabis Cup - 1st Place for Best Indica
2004 High Times Cannabis Cup - 2nd Place for Best Indica",Virginia Co.,"At the Virginia Company, the most important goal is consistency. Consistency in flavor. Consistency in potency. Consistency in quality. And the only way to achieve unequalled consistency is to have complete control of your cannabis from seed to seal.

It starts with our Controlled-Environment Agriculture (CEA) approach. Our grow has been engineered to leave nothing in the growing process to chance and allow us to dial in temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, nutrient concentration, and nutrient pH for each individual strain. A controlled environment also means nothing from the outside gets in and only the most potent cannabis is shipped out.

What makes the Virginia Company cannabis so special is the way it’s grown: high-pressure aeroponics. To be clear, this is not hydroponics—it’s better. High-pressure aeroponics is a system whereby the roots, suspended in air, are saturated by a fine mist of water and nutrients. And because the roots are suspended, there’s zero soil and 100% oxygen and carbon dioxide reception. The result is flower achieving its genetic potential every single time. And as a bonus, high-pressure aeroponics uses 65% less water than hydroponics, so you can rest assured it’s environmentally friendly too."
