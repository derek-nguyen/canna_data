Now that society has moved in a more positive direction regarding the medicinal and recreational use of cannabis, Tommy’s voice continues to ring out loudly, touting its benefits and place in society.  His message has never changed, and his passion has remained as strong as it was on stage many years ago.  Now Tommy is thrilled to share that passion and knowledge of cannabis with the rest of the world.  Using his lifelong connections in the industry, he has made it his personal mission to share the very best product available with his fans and fellow herb connoisseurs.
