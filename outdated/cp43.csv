Sit down for this one.  :),"The Hog is a 100% pure indica hybrid strain of unknown parentage due to a high level of breeder secrecy. This bud is internationally recognized as one of the world’s strongest strains and users are often advised to use cautionary dosage control when using it. It took home the gold medal in 2012 for Best Indica at the High Times’ Cannabis Cup after receiving recognition for its effects. The high is powerful in nature, with an almost immediate onset of a blissfully euphoric state that is heavy in the head, giving you droopy eyes and a spacey mind. As you get lost helplessly in your own disconnected thought, your body will slowly succumb to a creeping body buzz that weighs you down and leaves you helplessly sedated. This couch-locked state is very sleepy in nature, leaving you incredibly drowsy and most likely ending in deep and uninterrupted sleep. These effects and its insanely powerful THC level of 16-25% on average makes The Hog the perfect bud for treating conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, inflammation, chronic stress or anxiety, and mild to moderate cases of depression. This bud has lumpy medium-sized spade-shaped dark musty green nugs with sparse dark amber hairs and a super sticky coating of sweet syrupy resin. The Hog has a classic aroma of skunky earth with a spicy floral pungency that can be detected after the nugs are burned. The flavor is less harsh, with an earthy skunkiness that’s accented by pungent floral and sweet spice.",Sacred Flower Farms,"Purveyors of Goodness
Sacred Flower Farms is an OLCC-licensed recreational cannabis producer in the heart of Southern Oregon committed to self-sustaining cultivation methods that go above and beyond to create a superior product.
Much of the cannabis industry has been taken over by chemical nutrient manufacturers. Growers have forgotten how to grow with nature. We believe that only the cleanest flowers can truly showcase the healing properties of cannabis.

An Honest Grow
We never use synthetic fertilizers, poisonous pesticides or harmful herbicides. We grow almost 100% of our farm inputs on site, alongside food for our families. We utilize Probiotic, Living Organic and Korean Natural Farming practices that build a better soil year after year, and a better product as a direct result.
We rely on a ""plants feed plants"" method, making our nutrients through lacto fermentations, as well as sprouted seed teas, compost teas, and botanical teas using homegrown, organic plants and herbs. A healthy soil food web is essential to a deficiency-free, pest-free garden and healthy, clean plants.

Share The Love
Our desire is to show that a sustainable, living organic flower can fully unleash the terpenes, flavonoids, and beneficial properties of the cannabis plant; exciting, enlightening, and healing consumers. We strive to be a model of the way cannabis can and should be cultivated.
We hope you are excited by the flowers produced through our careful strain selection and mindful farming practices, and encourage you to spread the good word about the work we do."

That’s why we’ve dedicated ourselves to offering the best cannabis and services available anywhere.

While we obsess about maintaining the world-renowned tradition of Humboldt’s superior quality, we also focused on breaking new ground in getting our excess medicine to patients that need it. By helping farmers and dispensaries smooth the reimbursement process, we’ve successfully developed a complete distribution network throughout the state.

We’re a growing network of farmers.
We’re run by a conscience, not a corporation. The founding members have lived in Humboldt for an average of 25 years. We raise our families in Humboldt, and we run our businesses throughout Humboldt County and in Arcata. We’re always interested in talking to like-minded farmers, so get in touch with us if you’d like to preserve the tradition of Humboldt quality and craft.

We work closely together.
By working together, we’re lowering the costs of production, establishing standards for superior consistency and quality control, competing in a competitive branded market, and preserving the heritage of Humboldt’s most notorious commodity.

We’re community-minded.
We’re not just a collective of farmers who share our accumulated knowledge and experience with each other. We also employ members of our community whenever possible and pay them living wages. We also work with local environmental engineers, lumber and construction companies, soil labs, nurseries, accountants, and more. Because we believe we’re all in it together.

We’re evolving.
Although we’ve been around for a while, we know reform is on its way and that we need to adapt. This requires vision and the ability to thrive in a new environment. We’re already leading by example, too. We are seeking to fully permit our farms and are actively pursuing compliance with county regulatory agencies.
