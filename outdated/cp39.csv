Favored for its smooth strong berry flavor and clear headed effects.,"Strawberry Cough grows smelling like a field of strawberries rooted in its genetics. The cough is inevitable from its Haze lineage. The strain is favored for its smooth strong berry flavor and clear headed effects. Characterized with iconic foxtails, the pine cone buds make for a classic christmas tree look.
Strawberry Cough is a heavy sativa leaning sativa dominant hybrid.  Its indica parent Strawberry Fields is shrouded in rumor regarding its true lineage.  An unknown grower from Vermont experimented with a Northern Lights and Haze cross and ended up with a strawberry phenotype that ultimately became what we understand as Kyle Kushman’s clone of Strawberry Cough.
Regardless of all the hearsay we have carried out our own internal control groups to give you the skinny on our Cough’s effects and traits.  The Strawberry aroma pervades all through its growing stages right until you consume its fruity goodness.  The uncanny strawberry taste is accompanied by a creamy finish.  The cough is appropriately named after the sharp cough you would normally have difficulty staving off from the high THC gleaned from hazes.  The high is a clearheaded energizing one and also relaxes without tiring you.",Pioneer Nuggets,"Founded in December 2013, Pioneer Production and Processing LLC is a first of its kind Washington State licensed manufacturer of cannabis products.

We finished 5 phenos, then picked the best two based on potency, flavor, and terpene profile.  Both phenos have a super sweet and citrusy smell, one smells a little more like strawberry lemonade and the other like a bucket of overripe strawberries.Both have very dense crystally nuggets, that produce a thick smooth and flavorful smoke with a psychedelic and euphoric high.

Like a good red wine, effects tend to be heavier in the body, while rounding out the experience with a pure kush flavor.","Hell’s Angel OG (also called Biker's Kush or just Hell's OG) is an indica-dominant hybrid that is said to contain OG Kush and Blackberry genetics. The strain’s origins are poorly documented, but popular myth will tell you Hell's Angel OG was bred by the biker ruffians themselves in Southern California. If nothing else, we could assume this strain is named after its fierce psychoactive effects that settle in quickly and heavily. Lifting stress from the mind and pain from the body, Hells Angels OG is a therapeutic strain commonly used to treat inflammation, insomnia, and PTSD. Underneath its dominant earthy flavors hides a subtle citrus, candy-like aroma. This hybrid produces large, heavy buds that flower in 8 to 9 weeks indoors while outdoor plants are ready for harvest during the September-October transition.",Sunday Goods,"Sunday Goods is here to make people feel good with a Cannabis experience that’s just right.
