Northern Lights is a descendant of an Indigenous Afghani and Thai Land race strains. Northern Lights and its many descendants are a favorite at the High Times Cannabis Cup and have taken home many awards. Northern Lights is known for its resin rich flowers and sweet, spicy flavor. This strain is perfect for bedtime to curb restlessness and relax.",Cannasol Farms,"Nature intended for plants to be grown in the sun, and at Cannasol Farms, it is our dedication to growing the finest cannabis for over 20 years that led us to recognize that sun grown plants produce a better product. With dozens of unique strains, we have spent years perfecting the art and science of sustainable cannabis.

Because we believe cannabis only reaches its full potential in a natural environment, we grow our plants under the powerful Okanogan sunshine. Our complex sativa dominant strains take longer to mature, and their colas (the flower of the plant) need natural full spectrum sunlight to develop mature trichomes, which leads to more potent and rich cannabinoid profiles. You can see, smell, and taste the difference.

Because quality takes time, we don’t rush the plant. Many growers get eager to package their product, leaving it too green and raw. In order to achieve a more complex and refined terpene profile, you need time to slow cure as you would a fine tobacco or coffee. Cannasol Farms proudly slow cures our flowers for taste and experience rarely achieved in cannabis today. We select the best colas of the harvest to be hanged dry and slow cured in cool, low oxygen conditions. This allows the chlorophyl to degrade which smooths the smoke and allows the terpenes to be fully expressed, enhancing the cannabinoid profile. Cannasol Farms proudly long cures our flowers for taste and experience rarely achieved in cannabis today.

Cannasol cannabis is pure and natural, free from harsh pesticides and artificial chemicals. Only baking soda, potassium bicarbonate, and vinegar is used to prevent mildew and mold and regulate PH."

Consistency in flavor. Consistency in potency. Consistency in quality. And the only way to achieve unequalled consistency is to have complete control of your cannabis from seed to seal.

It starts with our Controlled-Environment Agriculture (CEA) approach. Our grow has been engineered to leave nothing in the growing process to chance and allow us to dial in temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, nutrient concentration, and nutrient pH for each individual strain. A controlled environment also means nothing from the outside gets in and only the most potent cannabis is shipped out.

What makes the Virginia Company cannabis so special is the way it’s grown: high-pressure aeroponics. To be clear, this is not hydroponics—it’s better. High-pressure aeroponics is a system whereby the roots, suspended in air, are saturated by a fine mist of water and nutrients. And because the roots are suspended, there’s zero soil and 100% oxygen and carbon dioxide reception. The result is flower achieving its genetic potential every single time. And as a bonus, high-pressure aeroponics uses 65% less water than hydroponics, so you can rest assured it’s environmentally friendly too."

Popular myth maintains that Chemdawg and Hindu Kush parented OG Kush, passing on the distinct “kush” bud structure we see in many strains today. However, we can’t be sure because OG Kush first came from bag seed in the early 90s. The earliest propagators (now known as Imperial Genetics) are said to have brought the seeds out of Florida to Colorado and southern California, where it now flourishes. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush, some of which include Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Alpha OG. 

OG Kush is cherished for its ability to crush stress under the weight of its heavy euphoria.
