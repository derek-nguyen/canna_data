With dozens of unique strains, we have spent years perfecting the art and science of sustainable cannabis.

Because we believe cannabis only reaches its full potential in a natural environment, we grow our plants under the powerful Okanogan sunshine. Our complex sativa dominant strains take longer to mature, and their colas (the flower of the plant) need natural full spectrum sunlight to develop mature trichomes, which leads to more potent and rich cannabinoid profiles. You can see, smell, and taste the difference.

Because quality takes time, we don’t rush the plant. Many growers get eager to package their product, leaving it too green and raw. In order to achieve a more complex and refined terpene profile, you need time to slow cure as you would a fine tobacco or coffee. Cannasol Farms proudly slow cures our flowers for taste and experience rarely achieved in cannabis today. We select the best colas of the harvest to be hanged dry and slow cured in cool, low oxygen conditions. This allows the chlorophyl to degrade which smooths the smoke and allows the terpenes to be fully expressed, enhancing the cannabinoid profile. Cannasol Farms proudly long cures our flowers for taste and experience rarely achieved in cannabis today.

Cannasol cannabis is pure and natural, free from harsh pesticides and artificial chemicals. Only baking soda, potassium bicarbonate, and vinegar is used to prevent mildew and mold and regulate PH."

With the passing of Initiative 502 in the fall of 2013 came the realization that opportunity was at hand. Having had experience growing for the medical side of the industry and a true passion for the plant, Max, Ryan and Spencer came together and founded what is now Royal Tree Gardens.

In March 2014, without the certainty of being licensed by the state, we apprehensively signed a lease on a warehouse in Tacoma, WA, where together, over the next 7 months, we designed and built-out the warehouse from the ground up. Through countless hours of hard work and dedication, we were able to complete the majority of the build-out ourselves while concurrently developing a brand-centric business plan with a focus and commitment to quality. Starting with a blank canvas allowed us to combine our knowledge of the cannabis growing environment and design a truly top tier facility for our plants.

In December 2014, after countless obstacles and setbacks, and applicable permits in hand, we finally received our license from the Washington State Liquor Control Board and were given the go ahead to begin producing cannabis.

More recently, after months of unconditional labor, we have welcomed on Judd as a part of the ownership. Charlie, a Master Grower and brother of Co-Founder Max, has also been added as a part of the ownership team and brings invaluable experience and work ethic.

Presently, the team here at Royal Tree Gardens is working extremely hard to produce the highest quality cannabis for the recreational market here in Washington. We feel privileged to be working with so many close friends and are excited share with you our passion for the plant!"

Sacred Flower Farms is an OLCC-licensed recreational cannabis producer in the heart of Southern Oregon committed to self-sustaining cultivation methods that go above and beyond to create a superior product.
Much of the cannabis industry has been taken over by chemical nutrient manufacturers. Growers have forgotten how to grow with nature. We believe that only the cleanest flowers can truly showcase the healing properties of cannabis.

An Honest Grow
We never use synthetic fertilizers, poisonous pesticides or harmful herbicides. We grow almost 100% of our farm inputs on site, alongside food for our families. We utilize Probiotic, Living Organic and Korean Natural Farming practices that build a better soil year after year, and a better product as a direct result.
We rely on a ""plants feed plants"" method, making our nutrients through lacto fermentations, as well as sprouted seed teas, compost teas, and botanical teas using homegrown, organic plants and herbs. A healthy soil food web is essential to a deficiency-free, pest-free garden and healthy, clean plants.

Share The Love
Our desire is to show that a sustainable, living organic flower can fully unleash the terpenes, flavonoids, and beneficial properties of the cannabis plant; exciting, enlightening, and healing consumers. We strive to be a model of the way cannabis can and should be cultivated.
We hope you are excited by the flowers produced through our careful strain selection and mindful farming practices, and encourage you to spread the good word about the work we do."

Lineage: Dutch Treat x Hawaiian Sativa

Hawaiian Dutch is a silky smooth sativa that satisfies even the discerning smoker. It combines the wickedly popular Dutch Treat, an indica-dominant hybrid, with a pure Hawaiian sativa. The result is a truly epic smoking experience, even for the connoisseur.  The Dutch, as we like to call it, carries an understated, slightly earthy, citrus smell, and an exquisite taste.  The effects reflect the hybrid lineage, giving you the sativa rush of focused, uplifting energy, along with the classic indica body high.
