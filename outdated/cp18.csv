This strain can also be very calming and help with concentration.",Cannasol Farms,"Nature intended for plants to be grown in the sun, and at Cannasol Farms, it is our dedication to growing the finest cannabis for over 20 years that led us to recognize that sun grown plants produce a better product. With dozens of unique strains, we have spent years perfecting the art and science of sustainable cannabis.

Because we believe cannabis only reaches its full potential in a natural environment, we grow our plants under the powerful Okanogan sunshine. Our complex sativa dominant strains take longer to mature, and their colas (the flower of the plant) need natural full spectrum sunlight to develop mature trichomes, which leads to more potent and rich cannabinoid profiles. You can see, smell, and taste the difference.

Because quality takes time, we don’t rush the plant. Many growers get eager to package their product, leaving it too green and raw. In order to achieve a more complex and refined terpene profile, you need time to slow cure as you would a fine tobacco or coffee. Cannasol Farms proudly slow cures our flowers for taste and experience rarely achieved in cannabis today. We select the best colas of the harvest to be hanged dry and slow cured in cool, low oxygen conditions. This allows the chlorophyl to degrade which smooths the smoke and allows the terpenes to be fully expressed, enhancing the cannabinoid profile.

Packs a punch!",,Sacred Flower Farms,"Purveyors of Goodness
Sacred Flower Farms is an OLCC-licensed recreational cannabis producer in the heart of Southern Oregon committed to self-sustaining cultivation methods that go above and beyond to create a superior product.
Much of the cannabis industry has been taken over by chemical nutrient manufacturers. Growers have forgotten how to grow with nature. We believe that only the cleanest flowers can truly showcase the healing properties of cannabis.

An Honest Grow
We never use synthetic fertilizers, poisonous pesticides or harmful herbicides. We grow almost 100% of our farm inputs on site, alongside food for our families. We utilize Probiotic, Living Organic and Korean Natural Farming practices that build a better soil year after year, and a better product as a direct result.
We rely on a ""plants feed plants"" method, making our nutrients through lacto fermentations, as well as sprouted seed teas, compost teas, and botanical teas using homegrown, organic plants and herbs. A healthy soil food web is essential to a deficiency-free, pest-free garden and healthy, clean plants.

Share The Love
Our desire is to show that a sustainable, living organic flower can fully unleash the terpenes, flavonoids, and beneficial properties of the cannabis plant; exciting, enlightening, and healing consumers. We strive to be a model of the way cannabis can and should be cultivated.
We hope you are excited by the flowers produced through our careful strain selection and mindful farming practices, and encourage you to spread the good word about the work we do."
