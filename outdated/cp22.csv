Durban Poison can be very uplifting and energizing, which makes it a great daytime strain.",Cannasol Farms,"Nature intended for plants to be grown in the sun, and at Cannasol Farms, it is our dedication to growing the finest cannabis for over 20 years that led us to recognize that sun grown plants produce a better product. With dozens of unique strains, we have spent years perfecting the art and science of sustainable cannabis.

Because we believe cannabis only reaches its full potential in a natural environment, we grow our plants under the powerful Okanogan sunshine. Our complex sativa dominant strains take longer to mature, and their colas (the flower of the plant) need natural full spectrum sunlight to develop mature trichomes, which leads to more potent and rich cannabinoid profiles. You can see, smell, and taste the difference.

Because quality takes time, we don’t rush the plant. Many growers get eager to package their product, leaving it too green and raw. In order to achieve a more complex and refined terpene profile, you need time to slow cure as you would a fine tobacco or coffee. Cannasol Farms proudly slow cures our flowers for taste and experience rarely achieved in cannabis today. We select the best colas of the harvest to be hanged dry and slow cured in cool, low oxygen conditions. This allows the chlorophyl to degrade which smooths the smoke and allows the terpenes to be fully expressed, enhancing the cannabinoid profile. Cannasol Farms proudly long cures our flowers for taste and experience rarely achieved in cannabis today.

Cannasol cannabis is pure and natural, free from harsh pesticides and artificial chemicals. Only baking soda, potassium bicarbonate, and vinegar is used to prevent mildew and mold and regulate PH."

With the passing of Initiative 502 in the fall of 2013 came the realization that opportunity was at hand. Having had experience growing for the medical side of the industry and a true passion for the plant, Max, Ryan and Spencer came together and founded what is now Royal Tree Gardens.

In March 2014, without the certainty of being licensed by the state, we apprehensively signed a lease on a warehouse in Tacoma, WA, where together, over the next 7 months, we designed and built-out the warehouse from the ground up. Through countless hours of hard work and dedication, we were able to complete the majority of the build-out ourselves while concurrently developing a brand-centric business plan with a focus and commitment to quality. Starting with a blank canvas allowed us to combine our knowledge of the cannabis growing environment and design a truly top tier facility for our plants.

In December 2014, after countless obstacles and setbacks, and applicable permits in hand, we finally received our license from the Washington State Liquor Control Board and were given the go ahead to begin producing cannabis.

More recently, after months of unconditional labor, we have welcomed on Judd as a part of the ownership. Charlie, a Master Grower and brother of Co-Founder Max, has also been added as a part of the ownership team and brings invaluable experience and work ethic.

Presently, the team here at Royal Tree Gardens is working extremely hard to produce the highest quality cannabis for the recreational market here in Washington. We feel privileged to be working with so many close friends and are excited share with you our passion for the plant!"
